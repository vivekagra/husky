# ROS Tutorial for Controlling Robot using Voice
ROS tutorial by Purdue SMART lab: This tutorial shows how to use ROS packages to control robot using voice.

# Objectives
This tutorial briefly covers how to control a robot over voice command. The user can control the robot using voice command and the robot acknowledges back to the user through a text-to-speech system, after executing the control action.

E.g. Once the user ask the robot to "forward". The robot executes it and then sends a message over voice to the user saying the the "Requested action executed".
